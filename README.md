# OvalRunner
Endless runner but fps

I dont really know what to put here, i kinda just threw everything together last minute. I made sure to use pointers where i could.
The obsticles class was designed with Blueprints in mind for variations in the obstacles.
The spawner accepts any blueprint that inherets from the obsticles class, and im planning on making it an array so i can add more super easily.

Sorry that i didnt get alot done before this deadline, was sick for like 2 weeks.
